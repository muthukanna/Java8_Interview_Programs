Java 8 Feature Implementations
This repository contains various Java 8 programs demonstrating modern features introduced in the JDK. The code is categorized into different sets for better organization and accessibility.
Features Covered:
- Lambda Expressions – Simplified syntax for functional programming.
- Streams API – Efficient data processing operations.
- Optional Class – Handling null values in a more controlled manner.
- Method References – Concise alternative to lambdas.
- Functional Interfaces – Customizable and reusable function definitions.
- Default & Static Methods in Interfaces – Enhancing interface capabilities.
- Collectors and GroupingBy – Advanced data manipulation.
- Date and Time API – Modernized date handling.

How to Use:
- Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the source directory and explore the different sets.
- Execute the programs using a compatible Java compiler (Java 8 or later).
Feel free to add details specific to your implementation and customize it as needed! If you’re planning to include documentation or README enhancements, I can help refine it further.
